      <description>Code of Conduct The Northeast Geobiology Symposium should be a place where all members of our community feel safe and included. As organizers, we hope to foster a collaborative, welcoming, and respectful environment. Behavior that prevents this from happening will not be tolerated.
Audio and video recording, or taking images of a presentation without the presentersâ€™ permission, is expressly forbidden. Images of posters taken without permission are not allowed. Images of posters may be taken with the explicit consent of the presenter, and images may be acquired only in the presence of the presenter.</description>
