      <description>Registration Registration is open until March 1, 2022 using this form.
In order to attend NE Geobio (or any event at MIT), you must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, including a booster shot. You will be asked to upload proof of vaccination (or an approved exception) to MIT&#39;s &amp;quot;Tim Ticket&amp;quot; system as we get closer to the conference.
As of January 10, 2022, we are planning to host a one-day, in-person event at MIT.</description>
